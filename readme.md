# Prevent Focus Stealing

Prevents focus from being stolen.
Useful for when a new window is opened on file save, like during game development.

## Usage

Add a comma separated list of wm_class strings to the input box in the settings and it will prevent windows with the matching wm_class from stealing focus. Clicking on it will give it focus.
